My name is Roberto Acevedo. I'm a
[*nix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) guy with a thing for functional
programming. I enjoy toying with new programming languages in my spare time,
and am currently hooked on [Clojure](http://clojure.org). For a living, I build
applications in [Java](http://www.java.com/). You can usually find me hacking
away at something on [Github](https://github.com/rxacevedo/), with my head buried 
in a [book](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29672793-roberto-acevedo), or out
running and enjoying the great outdoors. If you'd like to get in touch, feel free 
to click one of the fancy social media icons there on the bottom, or use the mailto 
link.
